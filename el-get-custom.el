  "Additional package recipes

Each entry is a PLIST where the following properties are
supported.

If your property list is missing the :type property, then it's
merged with the recipe one, so that you can override any
definition provided by `el-get' recipes locally.

:name

    The name of the package. It can be different from the name of
    the directory where the package is stored (after a `git
    clone' for example), in which case a symlink will be created.

:depends

    A single package name, or a list of package names, on which
    the package depends.  All of a packages dependencies will be
    installed before the package is installed.

:builtin

    A string containing the Emacs version (see `emacs-version' variable)
    from which Emacs includes the recipe as a builtin.  For example,
    `package.el' (the implementation of ELPA) is part of Emacs 24
    but needs an external recipe for previous major versions.

:pkgname

    The name of the package for the underlying package management
    system (`apt-get', `fink' or `pacman', also supported by
    `github' and `emacsmirror'), which can be different from the
    Emacs package name.

:type

    The type of the package, currently el-get offers support for
    `apt-get', `elpa', `git', `github', `emacsmirror', `git-svn',
    `bzr' `svn', `cvs', `darcs', `fink', `ftp', `emacswiki',
    `http-tar', `pacman', `hg' and `http'. You can easily support
    your own types here, see the variable `el-get-methods'.

:branch

    Which branch to pull when using `git' (and by extension,
    `github' and `emacsmirror', which are derived form `git') and
    `hg' backends.  Also supported when installing el-get using
    `el-get-install'.

:url

    Where to fetch the package, only meaningful for `git' and
    `http' types.

:pkgname

    For the `github' type, this specifies the repo name to clone
    from Github. For example, for el-get, the package name would
    be \"dimitri/el-get\". Note that the `emacsmirror' type is
    just like the `github' type with the prefix \"emacsmirror/\"
    automatically supplied.

:build

    Your build recipe, a list.

    A build command C whose `car' is a symbol (see `symbolp') will be
    replaced by (eval C).

    Then, each element of the recipe will be interpreted as
    a command:

    * If the element is a list of string, the first element of
      the list must be the program to call, and each following
      element a different argument to the call.  No whitespace
      parsing is done.

    * Otherwise, if it is a list, any list sub-elements will be
      recursively \"flattened\" (see `el-get-flatten').  The
      resulting strings will be interpreted as individual shell
      arguments, appropriately quoted.

:build/system-type

    Your specific build recipe for a given `system-type' gets
    there and looks like :build.

:load-path

    A directory or a list of directories you want `el-get' to add
    to your `load-path'. Those directories are relative to where
    the package gets installed.

:compile

    Allow to restrict what to byte-compile: by default, `el-get'
    will compile all elisp files in the :load-path directories,
    unless a :build command exists for the package source. Given
    a :compile property, `el-get' will only byte-compile those
    given files, directories or filename-regexpes in the property
    value. This property can be a `listp' or a `stringp' if you
    want to compile only one of those.

:info

    This string allows you to setup a directory where to find a
    'package.info' file, or a path/to/whatever.info file. It will
    even run `ginstall-info' for you to create the `dir' entry so
    that C-h i will be able to list the newly installed
    documentation. Note that you might need to kill (C-x k) your
    info buffer then C-h i again to be able to see the new menu
    entry.

:load

    List of files to load, or a single file to load after having
    installed the source but before `require'ing its features.

:features

    List of features el-get will `require' for you.

:autoloads

    Control whether el-get should generate autoloads for this
    package. Setting this to nil prevents el-get from generating
    autoloads for the package. Default is t. Setting this to a
    string or a list of string will load the named autoload
    files.

:library

    When lazy, :library sets the file against which to register
    the :after and :post-init forms for `eval-after-load'.  It
    defaults to the first :feature, :pkgname or :package, in that
    order.  See also `el-get-eval-after-load'.

:options

    Currently used by http-tar and cvs support.

    When using http-tar, it allows you to give the tar options
    you want to use. Typically would be \"xzf\", but you might
    want to choose \"xjf\" for handling .tar.bz files e.g.

    When using CVS, when it's set to \"login\", `el-get' will
    first issue a `cvs login' against the server, asking you
    interactively (in the minibuffer) any password you might to
    enter, and only then it will run the `cvs checkout' command.

:module

    Currently only used by the `cvs' support, allow you to
    configure the module you want to checkout in the given URL.

:repo

    Only used by the `elpa' support, a cons cell with the
    form (NAME . URL), as in `package-archives'.  If the package
    source only specifies a URL, the URL will be used for NAME as
    well.

:prepare

    This should be a lisp form to evaluate after both the
    `Info-directory-list' and the `load-path' variables have been
    taken care of, but before loading the package or any further
    action from `el-get-init'.  It will be run with
    `default-directory' set to the package directory.

:before

    This exactly like `:prepare' property, but is reserved for
    user customizations in `el-get-sources'.  Recipe files should
    not use this property.  It will be run just after `:prepare'.

:post-init

    Intended for use from recipes.  This should be a lisp form to
    evaluate once the :load and :features have been setup.  When
    lazy, it will be registered for `eval-after-load' against the
    recipe :library instead.  Like `:prepare', it will be run
    with `default-directory' set to the package directory.

:after

    This exactly like the `:post-init' property, but is reserved
    for user customizations in `el-get-sources'.  Recipe files
    should not use this property.  It will be run just after
    `:post-init' and after any per-package user-init-file (see
    `el-get-user-package-directory').

:lazy

    Default to nil.  Allows to override `el-get-is-lazy' per
    package.

:localname

    Currently only used by both `http' and `ftp' supports, allows
    to specify the target name of the downloaded file.

    This option is useful if the package should be retrieved using
    a presentation interface (such as as web SCM tool).

    For example, destination should be set to \"package.el\" if
    the package url has the following scheme:

   \"http://www.example.com/show-as-text?file=path/package.el\"

:website

    The website of the project.

:description

    A short description of the project.

:checksum

    Some methods in el-get download files that are not so
    trusted (e.g. anyone is allowed to modify emacswiki anytime).
    For these cases you can set up a checksum value for a
    package, so you will notice if el-get tries to install a
    version that you haven't seen before.  The installation will
    simply fail and you will see the good and bad checksum values
    in `*Messages*'.  To get the checksum value for a package
    initially, install the package while `el-get-verbose' is on.

    Checksum calculation is currently supported by these methods
    with the following meaning:

      * `http', `ftp' and `emacswiki' with the SHA1 of the downloaded file
      * `git' and `hg' in which it is an alias for `:checkout' (see below)

    In the `git' and `hg' recipe types, note that while
    `:checkout' will accept other things like branches, tags, and
    so forth,`:checksum' must only be given a commit hash. This
    will effectively lock the repository at a particular
    revision. Note also that `:checksum' must be set to the full
    hash, not just the first 6 or 8 characters (this restriction
    may be removed in the future).

:checkout

    For `git' or `hg' recipes, a branch name, tag, or other valid
    argument to `git checkout'/`hg update'. If provided, this
    overrides any value for the `:branch' property. Unlike the
    `:branch' property, this can be any valid argument to
    `checkout', including a tag name or a commit hash.

    When given a commit hash or tag, this will lock the repo at
    that specific revision. When given a branch name, this will
    always update the repo to the latest version of that branch,
    regardless of any changes made locally (in contrast to simply
    using the `:branch' property, which will cause el-get-to try
    to merge your local changes).

    Currently this property only has meaning for `git' and `hg'
    type recipes. Other VCS-based methods may implement support
    in the future.

:shallow

    If set to t in a git recipe, git-clone will be run with
    `--depth 1', which will create a so-called shallow clone by
    not downloading all the history of the repository. The
    default is controlled by the variable
    `el-get-git-shallow-clone', which is nil by default.

:submodule

   If set to nil in a git recipe, submodules will not be updated.
