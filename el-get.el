;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Version String are now inspired by how Emacs itself numbers its version.
;; First is the major version number, then a dot, then the minor version
;; number.  The minor version number is 0 when still developping the next
;; major version.
;;
;; So 2.0 is a developer release while 2.1 will be the next stable release.
;;
;; Please not that this versioning policy has been picked while backing
;; 1.2~dev, so 1.0 was a "stable" release in fact.  Ah, history.

;;; Change Log:
;;
;;  2.0 - WIP - Still growing, getting lazy
;;
;;   - Add support for autoloads, per Dave Abrahams
;;   - fix 'wait support for http (using sync retrieval)
;;   - code cleanup per Dave Abrahams, lots of it
;;   - add function M-x el-get-update-all
;;   - Implement M-x el-get-make-recipes
;;   - byte-compile at build time rather than at init time
;;   - and use a "clean room" external emacs -Q for byte compiling
;;   - allow to skip autoloads either globally or per-package
;;   - better checks and errors for commands used when installing packages
;;   - register `el-get-sources' against the custom interface
;;   - el-get will now accept a list of sources to install or init
;;   - open el-get-{install,init,remove,update} from `el-get-sources' only
;;   - add :prepare and :post-init and :lazy, and `el-get-is-lazy'
;;   - add support for :repo for ELPA packages
;;
;;  1.1 - 2010-12-20 - Nobody's testing until the release
;;
;;   - Adapt to package.el from Emacs24 by using relative symlinks to ELPA
;;     packages ((package-user-dir) is "~/.emacs.d/elpa" now, so needs to
;;     get expanded at least)
;;   - Allow to bypass byte compiling entirely with a single global var
;;   - Have http local file default to something sane, not package.el
;;   - Implement support for svn and darcs too
;;   - Still more recipes
;;   - Add support for the `pacman' package manager (ARCH Linux)
;;   - Add support for mercurial
;;   - (el-get 'sync) now really means synchronous, and serialized too
;;   - el-get-start-process-list implements :sync, defaults to nil (async)
;;   - Implement a :localname package property to help with some kind of URLs
;;   - Add el-get-post-init-hooks
;;   - Allow build commands to be evaluated, hence using some emacs variables
;;   - Finaly walk the extra mile and remove "required" packages at install
;;   - Implement support for the "Do you want to continue" apt-get prompt
;;   - implement :before user defined function to run before init
;;
;;  1.0 - 2010-10-07 - Can I haz your recipes?
;;
;;   - Implement el-get recipes so that el-get-sources can be a simple list
;;     of symbols. Now that there's an authoritative git repository, where
;;     to share the recipes is easy.
;;   - Add support for emacswiki directly, save from having to enter the URL
;;   - Implement package status on-disk saving so that installing over a
;;     previously failed install is in theory possible. Currently `el-get'
;;     will refrain from removing your package automatically, though.
;;   - Fix ELPA remove method, adding a "removed" state too.
;;   - Implement CVS login support.
;;   - Add lots of recipes
;;   - Add support for `system-type' specific build commands
;;   - Byte compile files from the load-path entries or :compile files
;;   - Implement support for git submodules with the command
;;     `git submodule update --init --recursive`
;;   - Add catch-all post-install and post-update hooks
;;   - Add desktop notification on install/update.
;;
;;  0.9 - 2010-08-24 - build me a shell
;;
;;   - have `el-get-build' use start-process-shell-command so that you can
;;     pass-in shell commands. Beware of poor command argument "parsing"
;;     though, done with a simple `split-string'.
;;
;;  0.8 - 2010-08-23 - listen to the users
;;
;;   - implement :after user defined function to run at the end of init
;;   - add CVS support (no login support)
;;   - improve el-get-build to use async building
;;   - fix el-get-update doing so
;;
;;  0.7 - 2010-08-23 - archive
;;
;;   - http support is extended to `tar' archives, via the http-tar type
;;
;;  0.6 - 2010-08-12 - towards a stable version
;;
;;   - fix when asynchronous http support call post-install-fun
;;   - fix el-get-remove calling convention
;;   - add support for bzr, thanks to Kevin Fletcher
;;
;;  0.5 - 2010-08-06 - release early, fix often
;;
;;   - fix apt-get and fink install hooks to call el-get-dpkg-symlink
;;   - fix elpa and http support to follow the new call convention
;;   - use asynchronous url-retrieve facility so that http is async too
;;
;;  0.4 - 2010-08-04 - foxy release
;;
;;   - support asynchronous processes for system commands
;;       apt-get, fink, git and git-svn are run in background
;;   - support `sudo' password prompts (classic and ubuntu variants)
;;   - fix fink support
;;   - ELPA support is an option so that you can install ELPA from el-get
;;   - implement el-get-rmdir

  "List of sources for packages.

Each source entry is either a symbol, in which case the first
recipe found in `el-get-recipe-path' directories named after the
symbol with a \".el\" extension will get used, or a PLIST where
the following properties are supported.

If your property list is missing the :type property, then it's
merged with the recipe one, so that you can override any
definition provided by `el-get' recipes locally.

:name

    The name of the package. It can be different from the name of
    the directory where the package is stored (after a `git
    clone' for example, in which case a symlink will be created.

:pkgname

    The name of the package for the underlying package management
    system (`apt-get', `fink' or `pacman'), which can be
    different from the Emacs package name.

:type

    The type of the package, currently el-get offers support for
    `apt-get', `elpa', `git' and `http'. You can easily support
    your own types here, see the variable `el-get-methods'.

:url

    Where to fetch the package, only meaningful for `git' and `http' types.

:build

    Your build recipe, a list.

    A recipe R whose `car' is not a string will be replaced
    by (eval R).

    Then, each element of the recipe will be interpreted as
    a command:

    * If the element is a string, it will be interpreted directly
      by the shell.

    * Otherwise, if it is a list, any list sub-elements will be
      recursively \"flattened\" (see `el-get-flatten').  The
      resulting strings will be interpreted as individual shell
      arguments, appropriately quoted.

:build/system-type

    Your specific build recipe for a given `system-type' gets
    there and looks like :build.

:load-path

    A directory or a list of directories you want `el-get' to add
    to your `load-path'. Those directories are relative to where
    the package gets installed.

:compile

    Allow to restrict what to byte-compile: by default, `el-get'
    will compile all elisp files in the :load-path directories,
    unless a :build command exists for the package source. Given
    a :compile property, `el-get' will only byte-compile those
    given files, directories or filename-regexpes in the property
    value. This property can be a `listp' or a `stringp' if you
    want to compile only one of those.

:info

    This string allows you to setup a directory where to find a
    'package.info' file, or a path/to/whatever.info file. It will
    even run `ginstall-info' for you to create the `dir' entry so
    that C-h i will be able to list the newly installed
    documentation. Note that you might need to kill (C-x k) your
    info buffer then C-h i again to be able to see the new menu
    entry.

:load

    List of files to load, or a single file to load after having
    installed the source but before `require'ing its features.

:features

    List of features el-get will `require' for you.

:autoloads

    Control whether el-get should generate autoloads for this
    package. Setting this to nil prevents el-get from generating
    autoloads for the package. Default is t. Setting this to a
    string or a list of string will load the named autoload
    files.

:library

    When using :after but not using :features, :library allows to
    set the library against which to register the :after function
    against `eval-after-load'.  It defaults to either :pkgname
    or :package, in this order.  See also `el-get-eval-after-load'.

:options

    Currently used by http-tar and cvs support.

    When using http-tar, it allows you to give the tar options
    you want to use. Typically would be \"xzf\", but you might
    want to choose \"xjf\" for handling .tar.bz files e.g.

    When using CVS, when it's set to \"login\", `el-get' will
    first issue a `cvs login' against the server, asking you
    interactively (in the minibuffer) any password you might to
    enter, and only then it will run the `cvs checkout' command.

:module

    Currently only used by the `cvs' support, allow you to
    configure the module you want to checkout in the given URL.

:repo

    Only used by the `elpa' support, a cons cell with the
    form (NAME . URL), as in `package-archives'.  If the package
    source only specifies a URL, the URL will be used for NAME as
    well.

:prepare

    Intended for use from recipes, it will run once both the
    `Info-directory-list' and the `load-path' variables have been
    taken care of, but before any further action from
    `el-get-init'.

:before

    A pre-init function to run once before `el-get-init' calls
    `load' and `require'.  It gets to run with `load-path'
    already set, and after :prepare has been called.  It's not
    intended for use from recipes.

:post-init

    Intended for use from recipes.  This function is registered
    for `eval-after-load' against the recipe library by
    `el-get-init' once the :load and :features have been setup.

:after

    A function to register for `eval-after-load' against the
    recipe library, after :post-init.  That's not intended for
    recipe use.

:lazy

    Default to nil.  Allows to override `el-get-is-lazy' per
    package.

:localname

    Currently only used by both `http' and `ftp' supports, allows
    to specify the target name of the downloaded file.

    This option is useful if the package should be retrieved using
    a presentation interface (such as as web SCM tool).

    For example, destination should be set to \"package.el\" if
    the package url has the following scheme:

   \"http://www.example.com/show-as-text?file=path/package.el\"

This will not update the sources by using `apt-get install' or

the el-get-sources setup.

el-get is also responsible for doing (require 'feature) for each

suitable for use in your emacs init script.

By default (SYNC is nil), `el-get' will run all the installs
concurrently so that you can still use Emacs to do your normal
work.

When SYNC is 'sync, each package will get installed one after the
other, and any error will stop it all.

When SYNC is 'wait, then `el-get' will enter a wait-loop and only
let you use Emacs once it has finished with its job. That's
useful an option to use in your `user-init-file'. Note that each
package in the list gets installed in parallel with this option.

Please note that the `el-get-init' part of `el-get' is always
done synchronously, so you will have to wait here. There's
`byte-compile' support though, and the packages you use are
welcome to use `autoload' too.

SOURCE-LIST is expected to be a list of sources you want to
install or init.  Each element in this list can be either a
package name, a package recipe, or a proper source list.  When
SOURCE-LIST is omited, `el-get-sources' is used."
