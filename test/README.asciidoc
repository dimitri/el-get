= Tests

Like, yes, we have some! :)

== el-get manual tests

Tries to cover some known issues, example that will allow building a
regression test suite some day.

Typical run:

  mkdir -p /tmp/test/.emacs.d
  rm -rf /tmp/test/.emacs.d/el-get/
  HOME=/tmp/test /usr/bin/emacs-snapshot-gtk -Q -batch -L . -l test/el-get-issue-303.el

At the moment you need to run the el-get-issue scripts with some known
working el-get version to know what to expect, and you probably need to have
el-get installed at +~/dev/emacs/el-get/+ for this to work as-is.

Yet it might be useful.

== el-get automated tests

See +test.el+ in this directory, and see the el-get-devel mailing list for a
promising patch to port the effort to +ert+.  This has yet to happen,
though.
